These community guidelines explain expected behavior and acceptable content when using the Appsudo platform. We’re committed to building a civil, respectful, and welcoming experience for everyone.

All users of the app must follow these guidelines in addition to our [Terms of Service](link-to-your-terms.html). We will enforce these rules, and violations may lead to account termination.

### **1. Zero tolerance for abusive users or harassment of others**
Attacking other community members through repeated unwanted interactions is prohibited.

### **2. Zero tolerance for hate speech**
Using the app to post hate speech is prohibited. This includes content that promotes discrimination, disparages, or humiliates an individual or group of people based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.

### **3. No posting illegal content**
Community members are expected to follow their local laws and regulations regarding acceptable content. Posting or promoting illegal acts is strictly forbidden.

### **4. No incitement to violence**
Posts encouraging violence towards other community members or other people are prohibited.

### **5. No spam**
Repeated posts, messages, and tagging of other community members in an unwanted or spam-like manner is prohibited.

### **6. No misleading impersonation**
While parody and satire are acceptable, deliberate impersonation of other people or brands in an attempt to mislead others is prohibited.

### **7. Respect intellectual property**
Posting content that violates another person or entity’s intellectual property rights is prohibited. Only post content that you have created yourself or have the legal right to share.
